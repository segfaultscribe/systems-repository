# About

A repository to work on systems level concpets focused on learning. Exploring low level CS concepts and coding them out to see how they actually work. This repo deals in all things low level - OS internals, C programming, Assembly, AI optimizations, CUDA etc. 

- [dynamic-array](./dynamic-array/) : Implementing dynamically growing arrays in C. No limit required in declaration unlike normal C arrays.
- [stack-growth](./stack-growth/) : Figuring out which direction the stack in memory grows(Up or Down).
- [File handling refresher](./FileHandling/) : A straightforward refresher to file handling in C.
- [custom printf()](./custom-printf/) : A custom printf() function from scratch using variadic arguments and write().

- [hexdump from scratch](./hexdump-II/) : `hexditch` a hexdump implementation in C with basic features. Supports ascii and colors.
